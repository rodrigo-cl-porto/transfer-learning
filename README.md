# Transfer Learning with Python

The project consists of applying the Transfer Learning method in a Deep Learning network in the Python language in the COLAB environment.

This repo is based on [Transfer Learning with MNIST Dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kylemath/ml4a-guides/blob/master/notebooks/transfer-learning.ipynb)

The image set used was the [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765).

## Observations

- The Cats and Dogs Dataset has 25.000 images (12.500 images for both Cats and Dogs classes), but I had to reduce the number of images to 6.000 (3.000 for both classes) due to insufficient memory.
